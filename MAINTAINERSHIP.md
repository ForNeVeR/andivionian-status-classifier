Maintainership
==============

Prepare a New Release
---------------------
To prepare a new release, perform the following actions:
1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
2. Merge all the changes into the `main` branch via a pull request.

All the changes are automatically published to https://andivionian.fornever.me by the CD pipeline, so no further actions are required.
